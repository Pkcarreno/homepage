# About

## Who am I?

I'm a human being (apparently) who enjoys the peculiarities of software. I lean
toward lower-level interaction with the machine, yet I operate as a frontend
engineer, navigating the technical and architectural complexities of web
projects that extend far beyond the browser.

Sometimes [I build things](/projects). That's what humans do.

## What is this site?

It's a refinement (yet again) of my personal website. I'm dealing with the
dilemma of how to maintain an online presence without sacrificing my privacy.

In the past, my website was nothing more than a tool that complemented my
professional profile. In this iteration, I want to move away from that purpose
and make it more of a garden of experimentation where I can showcase my projects
and thoughts that may (or may not) be useful.

## Why this sudden change?

**Privacy.**

I've become increasingly concerned about privacy on the
internet, as I believe that users are so amazed by the capabilities of
technology that they (myself included) rarely take the time to understand the
inherent compromises involved.

Nothing can be done about what has already been exposed, but my goal is to
reduce further exposure.

I won't go into reasons, [privacyguides.org](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/basics/why-privacy-matters/) explains it very well.

## Who are YOU?

That's a good question. Have you ever thought about it?
