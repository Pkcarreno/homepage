  <p>
    Made in Venezuela in the late 90s. My name is Pedro. I'm a Front-End and
    mobile application developer with 4+ years of professional experience. I
    have led the Front-End development of complex and highly dynamic platforms
    using React.js, Next.js and Vue.js technologies, as well as mobile apps with
    React Native (and Expo).
  </p>
  <p>
    Furthermore, I love technology, philosophy, history, music and video games.
    I'm excited about open source, Linux and minimalism because they combine
    several of my passions. I've migrated my digital workflow to open source,
    and I've been involved in projects that I identify with and bring value to
    my day-to-day life. In the same way, I try to create <Link
      href="https://github.com/Pkcarreno?tab=repositories">FOSS tools</Link
    > that can be useful.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is my personal blog where I intend to share content on topics of my
    interest such as development, FOSS and privacy. I had not had an excuse to
    have a blog because «I already get the content that interests me», but
    almost everything is in English, and it is a journey to get valuable content
    in Spanish, for that reason I am focusing my blog to the Hispanic community.
    Also, I really like this idea of <Link href="https://smallweb.page/why"
      >small webs</Link
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Note</b>: You can get the links to my platforms in the <Link
      href="#barra-navegacion">navigation bar</Link
    >.

          In this app you can run and share JavaScript code from your browser,
          locally, respecting your privacy. My intention is to have a way to do
          data manipulation without altering the code of the project I'm working
          on and also to be able to share useful scripts (like calculators for
          specific purposes) with family and friends without them having to go
          through a login.
