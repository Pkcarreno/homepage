# LocalTag

A free, local-first utm link management web app with templates and advanced parameter configuration.

![localtag app with a demo project](@/assets/images/projects/localtag/intro.png)

## usage

Navigate to [localtag.app](https://localtag.app) and follow the instructions.

The proposed workflow is as follows:

```
Create Project > Open Project > Generate Links
```

### configuration

General app configuration is accesible via the three-dot button at the bottom
near the left corner. Here you can configure the language, appearance, and
backup functions.

### import & export

The backup functionality works in two ways:

- Individual project backup: Exportable from project settings or the sidebar
  options menu. These can be imported from the **new project** menu.
- Global bakcup: Export and import from the general configuration menu.

Importing a backup is a non-destructive process. If you import an individual
project or a series, they are added to existing ones even if they already exist
in the system, copies will be appropriately identified.


### project configuration

Accesible from the project view via the gear button in the top right.
The following can be edited:

- Base URL.
- URL Parameters.
- Navigation hierarchy.

Projects can also be exported from this menu.

## motivation

While implementing UTM links for a campaign, I found existing apps were quite
simple and left much to be desired. I wanted a tool that functioned more as a 
creator and manager of links-one that helps differentiate existing links from 
those yet to be created, while providing quick access and the ability to create 
variants from existing links.

It also seemed relevant to support multiple parameter formats, as most 
generators strictly follow a single set of rules, mostly google's.

## internals

This project is built using the following stack:

- Framework: Based on [astro-minimal-template](/projects/astro-minimal-template).
- Frontend: React is used through astro islands.
- Persistence: Data is stored locally using _indexedDB_ via the idb library for
  project-related data.
- State Management: Nanostores.

## _ViBecOdiNg_

This is the first app I have developed entirely with AI. While I'm not entirely
comfortable with the fact yet, I'm quite happy with the result and impressed by 
how far I was able to go with minimal direct code intervention.

I didn't actually plan on building this project. After seeing the state of 
current online tools, I designed an app concept but quickly archived it,
convinced I didn't have the time to bring it to life.

To experiment with current AI development tools, I decided to use that stored
concept and started with the canvas mode of `gemini-pro`. I wrote a detailed 
prompt about the app concept, explaining the workflow and how I conceived the 
UI/UX. The result felt like an MVP with solid foundations.

The next step was starting a local project based on my 
[astro-minimal-template](/projects/astro-minimal-template). Once created, I 
used **antigravity** and provided the previously generated file. My prompt was:

> Analyze the attached HTML code. Integrate this app into the Astro project by
> separating components by responsibility and common utilities into their own
> instance for better reuse. Use React for interactivity.

The AI understood the internal responsibilities well and separated them into
independent files. I only had to fix specific issues related to library usage.
Afterward, I iterated many times, adding features and refactoring those to 
extend them.

The process was so fast that I struggled to decide when to stop to launch the 
app. Having the ideas fresh and being focused on details allowed me to add, fix 
and optimize quickly. It took about a week to run out of ideas, so I decided to
publish it as a work-in-progress.

### what i learned

- AI allows for a very fast iteration, useful for rapid proofs of concept.
- AI makes mistakes, especially if the task description lacks specificity and
  detail.
- It may hallucinate library APIs if it does not have updated documentation at
  hand.
- Waiting for cycles of "accept and execute" util a task is resolved can be slow 
  and tedious.
- Adding rules allows for simpler prompts while ensuring tasks are completed as 
  expected.

## why not open-source?

In general, I enjoy sharing projects that help me be a more productive 
developer, and I feel aligned with the philosophy behind open-source.

However, I built this app believing it would be useful for developers, but I 
know that those who use these tools the most are marketing professionals. Since
I'm not familiar with this sector and most tools are designed to generate 
profit, I don't want this project to be cloned and used in that way.

For now, while I decide how to handle this, the app will remain closed-source, 
though I don't rule out publishing it one day.
